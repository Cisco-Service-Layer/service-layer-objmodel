// This API supports programming the device by multiple clients.
//
// If there are multiple clients intending to program the network
// element using this API, the clients initiating a programming or get
// RPC MUST pass a gRPC-context metadata identifying itself.
// The client application MUST set the gRPC metadata key
// named "iosxr-slapi-clientid" with a numeric string holding a
// number between 0 and 65535.
//
// Each client application MUST use a unique client ID identifying itself
// that is seperate from other clients programming the server. If there
// are multiple instances of the client application, then each such
// instance MUST be uniquely idenified.
//
// If "iosxr-slapi-clientid" gRPC metadata is missing, server assumes
// a default client id of 0 for that RPC invocation and associates
// objects programmed by that RPC with the default client id of 0.
//
// The co-ordination of the ClientId amongst these instances is outside
// the scope of this specification.
//
// Clients MUST not change their identity for their lifetime - such as
// RPC disconnects, process restarts or software update.
//
// SL-API stores the objects programmed by clients and preserves them across
// RPC disconnects, client restarts and server gRPC process restarts. As such
// if a client application or instance is no longer needed, the client
// MUST remove all its programming from the server before it is disabled
// or removed.
//
// The route redistribution and notifications are scoped to the RPC
// and as such do not require a client ID.

    // RPCs for object programming and access. Supported objects are
    // IP Routes, MPLS Labels, and Path Group objects and Policy
    // Forwarding Entries.
    //
    // A Path Group object created by one client can be referenced by
    // any other object (e.g. IP Route and MPLS label object) created by
    // ANY other client.
    //
    // Only the client that created the object (IP/MPLS, Policy Forwarding
    // Entry and Path Group included) can manipulate that object.

    //
    // VRF registration operations. The client MUST register with
    // the corresponding VRF table before programming objects in that table.
    //
    // SLAFVrfRegMsg.Oper = SL_REGOP_REGISTER:
    //     VRF table registration: Sends a list of VRF table registration
    //     messages and expects a list of registration responses.
    //     A client Must Register a VRF table BEFORE objects can be
    //     added/modified in the associated VRF table.
    //
    // SLAFVrfRegMsg.Oper = SL_REGOP_UNREGISTER:
    //     VRF table Un-registration: Sends a list of VRF table un-registration
    //     messages and expects a list of un-registration responses.
    //     This can be used to convey that the client is no longer interested
    //     in these VRF tables. All previously installed objects would be
    //     remove.
    //
    // SLAFVrfRegMsg.Oper = SL_REGOP_EOF:
    //     VRF table End Of File message.
    //     After Registration, the client is expected to send an EOF
    //     message to convey the end of replay of the client's known objects.
    //     This is especially useful under certain restart scenarios when the
    //     client and the server are trying to synchronize their objects.
    //
    // The VRF table registration operations can be used by the client to
    // synchronize objects with the device. When the client re-registers the
    // VRF table with the server using SL_REGOP_REGISTER, server marks
    // objects in that table as stale.
    // Client then MUST reprogram objects it is interested in.
    // When client sends SL_REGOP_EOF, any objects not reprogrammed
    // are removed from the device. This feature can be turned
    // off by setting SLVrfReg.NoMarking flag to True.
    //
    // The client MUST perform all operations (VRF registration, objects)
    // from a single execution context.
